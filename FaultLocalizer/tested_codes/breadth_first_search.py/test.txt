The bug can cause an infinite loop due to improper handling of the search range when x is greater than arr[mid]. 

This is what ChatGPT said, somehow the first and last value from the array don't produce a bad outcome, so the only test that we will need to investigate is the infinite recursion.

?Element at the beginning of the array (x = arr[0]): If x is the first element of the array, the function may incorrectly return -1 because the initial binsearch(0, len(arr)) call passes end as the length of the array. Since end is exclusive, the correct call should be binsearch(0, len(arr) - 1).
?Element at the end of the array (x = arr[-1]): Similar to the first case, if x is the last element of the array, the function may incorrectly return -1 due to the same reason mentioned above.
